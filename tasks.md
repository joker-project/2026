### Tasks 
<!--, evaluation setup, and metrics-->

* **Task 1: Humour-aware information retrieval** Retrieving short humorous texts from a document collection based on a given query. The retrieved texts should fulfill the dual criteria of being relevant to the query and being instances of wordplay.
  * English
  * Portuguese 
* **Task 2: Wordplay Translation** Translating English punning jokes into French. Translations should aim to preserve, to the extent possible, both the form and meaning of the original wordplay.
* **Task 3: Onomastic Wordplay Translation** The objective of the task is to translate onomastic wordplay from English to French. Such wordplay is widely used as a rhetorical device in novels, poetry, and plays.
* **JOKER 2022-2024 revisited** Previous tasks by popular requests (pun detection EN/FR/ES, pun location EN/FR/ES
<!--* **Task 4: Controlled Creativity** Identifying and avoiding hallucination. This is a possible new task coordinated between a number of tracks dealing with text generation tasks. The translation of humorous texts can require considerable creative effort, as a literal translation does not preserve the wordplay.-->
